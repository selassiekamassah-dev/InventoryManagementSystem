## 💾 Data Management

All inventory data is stored in the browser using **localStorage**:

```javascript
// Data structure
{
  name: "Product Name",
  sku: "SKU-001",
  category: "Electronics",
  price: "999.99",
  quantity: "5",
  status: "in_stock",
  flags: ["bestseller"],
  imageData: "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",
  createdAt: "2026-01-25T..."
}
```

**Important**:

- Data is stored locally in your browser
- Data persists across sessions
- Clearing browser cache will delete data
- Data doesn't sync across browsers/devices
